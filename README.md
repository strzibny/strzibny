Hello there,

**I am a full-stack Ruby and Elixir freelance software engineer.**

Here you can find some of my open source contributions such as [InvoicePrinter](https://github.com/strzibny/invoice_printer), a Ruby library to make PDF invoices. 

If you want to support me, the best way might be to buy my new book [Deployment from Scratch](https://deploymentfromscratch.com/) or my Rails SaaS starter template [Business Class](https://businessclasskit.com/).

If you are curious to read something from me, go read [my blog](https://nts.strzibny.name/).
